I hate how fickle our minds are. I love how malleable and plastic our minds are. I hate how I can be happy one moment, and sad the next. I hate how I have no control over myself. I love how life becomes interesting because of elements not under your control. Sometimes it feels like I am drawn to something, but I don't know what that thing is. It's a weird, sad feeling. If I could have complete control over myself, what would my life be like? Where would I be? Free from procrastination, from college, from etiquette, from the need to try and impress.

Will I ever really have control? Or have I been influenced by all the things around me, and now that the wheel is set in motion, I can do nothing about it? Am I equal to the sum of all my parts or am I greater than the sum of all my parts? Why do I need to be idealistic about everything? Maybe it's all the superhero fantasy stuff I saw as a kid. Striving to be something greater, they said. Do you even realize it, when you become "greater"? 

I know that this dissatisfaction I feel is normal. It propelled humanity to do something about themselves. But I hate feeling dissatisfied especially when there's no control. Is it normal to feel like you've bullshitted your way through life? Why is it that your accomplishments become a speck but your failures stand out? Okay, maybe 'why' is a stupid question. I know why. I just dislike that it is the way it is. 

Exploration vs exploitation. Am I spending too much time exploiting and not enough time exploring? There's more knowledge, books, music than I will ever explore. Why do I enjoy things of a particular kind, put myself in an echo chamber and then worry about not 'broadening' myself as a person. The world isn't a zero sum game, right? What's going to happen? Is everyone going to be okay? What about universal basic income? Things are going to get pretty complicated soon, aren't they?

Despite all this, we've come far.
