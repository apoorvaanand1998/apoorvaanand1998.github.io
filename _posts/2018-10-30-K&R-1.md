C provides a variety of datatypes - characters, integers and floating points. Along with these, there are the following derived datatypes - pointers, arrays, structures and unions. Every program must have a "main" function, as this is where the execution begins. You cannot name the "main" function as anything else. 

"printf" is not a part of the C language, it is present in the <stdio.h> library. "%6.2f" prints a floating point, _at least_ 6 wide and 2 after the decimal point. 

When taking characters as input, and using EOF to signify the end of input, we must declare a datatype big enough to hold the value of EOF. Therefore, we use the datatype int. The precedence of != is higher than =, which means one must use parentheses in the following way while taking in input:

`((c = getchar) != EOF)`

The grammatical rules of C require that a "for" statement have a body. So, when all of the work is done in the testing and incrementing part of for, we place a "null statement" in the body of the loop. 

A single character written in single quotes is called a character constant. It represents the integer value of that character, but is obviously more intuitive to write, instead of the ASCII value. 

**Ex 1_9: Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int c, cp;
    
    cp = 0; //any value that is not a space
    
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (cp == ' ' && c == ' ') 
            ;
        else {
            putchar(c);
            cp = c;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Ex 1_12: Write a program that prints its input one word per line.**

There are two ways that this program can be written. I can either keep track of the "state" or keep track of the previous character.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define OUT 0
#define IN 1


int main() 
{
    int c, state;
    
    state = OUT;
    
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (c != ' ' && c != '\n' && c != '\t') {
            state = IN;
            putchar(c);
        }
        else if (state == IN) {
            state = OUT;
            putchar('\n');
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int c, cp;
    
    cp = 0;
    
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if ((c == '\t' || c == ' ' || c == '\n') && (cp != '\n')) {
            putchar('\n');
            cp = '\n';
        }
        else if ((c == '\t' || c == ' ' || c == '\n') && (cp == '\n'))
            ;
        else {
            putchar(c);
            cp = c;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Ex 1_14: Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.**

I will be printing a vertical histogram. In this program, first you find the maximum frequency. From the max value, you iterate in reverse checking for every character if the value of that character's frequency is >= the current loop variable value. If it is, then you print a "*" for that variable of histogram, after the required number of spaces. During this, I found a shortcut for printing repeated characters, which is shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int c, i, j, m, fc[26];
    
    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++)
        fc[i] = 0;
    
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {
            ++fc[c - 'a'];
        }
    }
    
    
     for (i = 0; i < 26; i++)
        printf("fc[%c] = %d\n", (char)i + 'a', fc[i]);
    
    
    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++) 
        if (fc[i] > m)
            m = fc[i];
    
        
    for (j = m; j >= 1; j--) {
        for (i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (fc[i] >= j) {
                printf("%*c", i - 1, ' ');
                printf("*");
            }
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

In a function, variables are "called by value" in C. To "call by reference", one must pass the address of the variables to the caller, and called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer. This is not done with arrays as arrays are called by reference always. 

**Ex 1_18: Write a program to remove all trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.** 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int getline1(char line[], int lim);

int main()
{
    char line[1000];
    int len, i;
    
    while ((len = getline1(line, 1000)) > 0) {
        for (i = len - 1; ((line[i] == ' ') || (line[i] == '\t') || (line[i] == '\n')); --i) 
            ;
        line[++i] = '\n';
        line[++i] = '\0';
        printf("%s", line);
    }
    
    return 0;
}

int getline1(char line[], int lim)
{
    int c, i, j;
    
    i = j = 0;
    
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF && (c != '\n')) {
        if (i < lim - 1)
            line[j++] = c;
        ++i;
    }
    if (c == '\n') {
        if (i <= lim - 1)
            line[j++] = c;
        ++i;
    }
    line[j] = '\0';
    return i;
}
```

Until this point, all the exercises have been fairly trivial. This changes now.

**Ex 1_20: Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns.**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define TAB_WIDTH 8

int main()
{
    int c, x, i = 0;
    
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (c == '\n') {
            putchar('\n');
            i = 0;
        }
        
        else if (c == '\t') {
            x = (TAB_WIDTH - (i % TAB_WIDTH));
            
            for (int j = 0; j < x ; j++) {
                putchar(' ');
                i++;
            }
        }
            
        else {
            putchar(c);
            i++;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
The trick in this was to figure out the formula (can I call it that?) - (TAB_WIDTH - (i % TAB_WIDTH)). This involved thinking of the variable i, which kept track of the nth character in every line, and how it was related to the closest multiple of TAB_WIDTH. Eventually, through simple trial and error, I figured out how they were related. 

**Ex 1_21: Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks with the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same stops as for detab.**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define TAB_WIDTH 8

int main() 
{
    int c, nos, ctr, i, not, lt, rs;
    
    nos = ctr = not = 0;
    
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (c == '\n') { 
            nos = ctr = 0;
            putchar('\n');
        }
        else if ((nos == 0) && (c != ' ')) {
            putchar(c);
            ++ctr;
        }
        else if (c == ' ') {
            ++nos;
            ++ctr;
        }
        else if ((c != ' ') && (nos > 0)) {
            ++ctr;
            for (i = (ctr - nos); i < ctr; i++) {
                if (i % TAB_WIDTH == 0) {
                    ++not;
                    lt = i;
                }
            }
            rs = ctr - lt - 1;
            for (i = 0; i < not; i++)
                putchar('\t');
            for (i = 0; i < rs; i++)
                putchar(' ');
            putchar(c);
            nos = not = 0;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This program keeps track of the nth character in every line, and when it encounters a space, it keeps track of the number of spaces too. To fill it with tabs, it iterates from (ctr - nos) to ctr and tests if (i % TAB_WIDTH == 0), if it is, then that point is a tab stop, and so number of tabs is incremented by 1. lt = i is done so if there are remaining spaces left that tabs cannot fill, then it is filled with spaces.

I am going to skip ex 1_22 for now, and come back to it towards the end. Turns out, it was the hardest exercise in this chapter.

**Ex 1_23: Write a program to remove all comments from a C program.**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int c, cp, i, singlelinec, multilinec, commentpossible, justleftmlc, noq;
  char buf[1000];
  
  singlelinec = 0;
  multilinec = 0;
  commentpossible = 0;
  justleftmlc = 0;
  cp = -1;
  i = 0;
  noq = 0;

  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    justleftmlc = 0;

    if (c == '"')
      ++noq;
    
    if ((noq % 2) == 1)
      buf[i++] = c;
    
    else {      
      if (singlelinec == 1) {
	if (c == '\n') {
	  singlelinec = 0;
	}
      }
      if (multilinec == 1) {
	if ((cp == '*') && (c == '/')) {
	  multilinec = 0;
	  justleftmlc = 1;
	}
      }
    
      if ((cp == '/') && (c == '/')) {
	singlelinec = 1;
	commentpossible = 0;
      }
      if ((cp == '/') && (c == '*')) {
	multilinec = 1;
	commentpossible = 0;
      }

      if ((singlelinec == 0) && (multilinec == 0)) {
	if ((commentpossible == 1) && (c != '/')) {
	  buf[i++] = cp;
	  buf[i++] = c;
	  commentpossible = 0;
	}
	else if (c != '/') {
	  buf[i++] = c;
	}
	else if (justleftmlc == 0) {
	  commentpossible = 1;
	}
      }
    }
    cp = c;
  }
  buf[i] = '\0';
  printf("%s", buf);
  return 0;
}
```
This program might look big, and hard. But it's just a bunch of flow of control. When the time comes, you can figure this out. 

**Ex 1_24: Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality.)**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int c, parens, brackets, braces, sq, dq;

  parens = brackets = braces = 0;
  sq = dq = 1;

  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {

    if (c == '[')
      ++parens;
    if (c == ']')
      --parens;
    if (c == '(')
      ++brackets;
    if (c == ')')
      --brackets;
    if (c == '[')
      ++braces;
    if (c == ']')
      --braces;

    if (c == '\'')
      sq *= -1;
    if (c == '"')
      dq *= -1;
  }
  
  if ((parens != 0) || (brackets != 0) || (braces != 0))
    printf("Check your brackets/parentheses/braces.\n");
  if ((sq != 1) || (dq != 1))
    printf("Check your single/double quotes.\n");
  else
    printf("Things might be fine. But probably not.\n");

  return 0;
}
```
Very rudimentary approach, but I decided to stick with it since this is the first chapter. I know there's a stack implementation, maybe I'll come back to it later.

**Ex 1_22: Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n -th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.**

Here comes the hardest exercise of this chapter. The one I learned the most from. Initially, I had a solution that involved taking the entire input into a buffer. But I wanted to challenge myself by processing the input character by character and also having a buffer the size of the maximum column allowed.

Initially, I tried racking my brains to figure out a solution to this problem, but I simply couldn't. It was too "large" for me to puzzle out "just like that" in my head. I struggled and let go of it multiple times. Finally, I decided to take another approach. I started building up the program in small, tiny, very manageable steps. It seems obvious, that this was the thing to do now, in retrospect. But then, it didn't occur to me instantly at all. Here's how I made the program. 

1. First I printed out whenever there was a non-space to space transition.
2. Then I said printed whenever there was a non-space to space transition, AND i == MAXCOL.
3. Next I added a buffer that read all the characters in.
4. Then I added a spaceleft variable that kept track of how much space was left in that line.
5. if (i <= spaceleft), I printed the buffer (and obviously the buffer was flushed). This happened when there was a non-space to space transition.
5. Otherwise, I printed '\n' and printed the buffer in the next line WITHOUT the leading spaces. For this I kept track of the first non-space buffer character.

That's pretty much it. When I was thinking of an algorithm for this problem, the solution came to me in the form that, I had to keep track of "(spaces)(followed by non spaces)", and after that the solution would be simple. I just couldn't figure out how I could translate it into code. This step by step approach of transforming the thought in my head to code really helped. I will use it often in the future. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXCOL 10

void my_flush(char buf[]);

int main()
{
  int c, prev_char, i, j, ctr, spaceleft, first_non_space_buf;
  char buf[MAXCOL+2];

  prev_char = -1;
  i = first_non_space_buf = ctr = 0;
  spaceleft = MAXCOL;

  printf("Just keep typing once the output has been printed");
  
  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    if (buf[0] == '\n') {
      i = 0;
      my_flush(buf);
    }
    //printf("Prev char = %c and Current char = %c and i = %d and fnsb = %d and spaceleft = %d and j = %d and buf = %s \n", prev_char, c, i, first_non_space_buf, spaceleft, j,  buf);
    if ((((prev_char != ' ') && (prev_char != '\t') && (prev_char != '\n')) &&
	 ((c == ' ') || (c == '\t') || (c == '\n'))) ||
	(i == MAXCOL)) {
      if (i <= spaceleft) {
	printf("%s", buf);
	spaceleft -= i;
      }
      else {
	putchar('\n');
	spaceleft = MAXCOL;
	for (j = first_non_space_buf; buf[j] != '\0'; ++j) {
	  putchar(buf[j]);
	  ++ctr;
	}
	spaceleft -= ctr;
      }
      i = 0;
      my_flush(buf);
      buf[i++] = c;
      first_non_space_buf = j = ctr = 0;
    }
    else {
      if (((prev_char == ' ') || (prev_char == '\t') || (prev_char == '\n')) &&
	  ((c != ' ') && (c != '\t') && (c != '\n'))) {
	first_non_space_buf = i;
      }
      buf[i++] = c;
      buf[i] = '\0';
    }
    prev_char = c;
  }
  printf("%s", buf);
  return 0;
}

void my_flush(char buf[])
{
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i < MAXCOL; ++i)
    buf[i] = '\0';
}
```

I know this program can be done with pointers. But I hadn't been taught pointers yet. When needed, I will implement this program with pointers. For then, (this)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5228209/c-programmings-kr-1-22-fold-input-problem?rq=1] might be helpful.
