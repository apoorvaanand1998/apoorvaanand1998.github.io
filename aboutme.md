subtitle: And why I decided to blog
---

My name is Apoorva Anand. I don't want to define myself with the qualities I currently have. Why? Probably because I'm embarrassed of them. 

The reason this blog exists is threefold : 
* To record my voyage.
* To help in the germination of seed crystals. 
* To rant and to ramble.
