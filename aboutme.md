subtitle: And why I decided to blog
---

My name is Apoorva Anand. I don't want to define myself with the qualities I currently have. Why? Probably because I'm embarrassed of them. 

The reason this blog exists is threefold. 
* First, the term blog has it's origins in "Web Log" - and _that_ is what I plan on doing here. I plan on recording my voyage, so to speak. 
* Secondly, it's a chance to put down my thoughts somewhere. Who knows? Maybe a few seed crystals might germinate. 
* Finally, I'm probably going to end up using this for rants and ramblings as well.
