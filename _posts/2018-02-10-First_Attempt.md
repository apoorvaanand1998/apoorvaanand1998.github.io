Courage (or let's say stupidity) has a strange way of finding itself in me when I've accrued a sleep debt. I wrote this in one of those times. This is a first for me because sharing something you've written is like revealing something intimate. And putting it on a website? That's you going "Here you go, judge me!"

I'm not a great writer. In fact, calling myself a writer of things would be the same as calling someone who eats meat with a knife, a butcher (As you can see, I'm _really_ not good with words). That being said, it's not something I particularly want to improve in (I hope that doesn't seem too arrogant or anything), so my incompetence isn't too big a deal for me. My words, for the most part, will do.

It was a dark, gloomy night when he got the thought. The kind of night you'd stay at home, flip through an old book or mindlessly search the web. The thought stewed and simmered in the corner of his mind as he did his mindless task. It started off as a blob in his head, but slowly evolved into a small worm that was burrowed in there. The worm wiggled as it tried to take over, shaking other thoughts in his head. Slowly, as he continued doing his dishes, or as he folded his clothes, it grew; growing into a mucous-like slime with a life of it's own. It swirled around his head, mixing, taking into it all the other smaller thoughts. With that consumption - it grew.

Colours appeared.

The thought now could not have been called a single thought, for it had multiple regions. Each with it's own colour. Each colour communicated with the other colours, yes, but they could hardly have been called a part of a thought. They were almost too grand to be called a part of anything, but a part they were, and there's comfort to be found in the acceptance of truth.

The thought then stopped. Immediately, he felt it's loss. It was  like a large part of his identity had been taken away. He'd infused the thought with his being, his soul, and now that it was gone, he felt emptiness. He tried doing something else, to take his mind off of things, but how could he? So, he lay there. Doing nothing. Perhaps a drift of a lesser thought here and there, but like the floating embers of a fire, they quickly vanished. He accepted his loss, and just lay there. Hours passed. The feeling of doing nothing started gnawing at him, so he got up, half-heartedly deciding to do something. 

He worked, and mourned the loss of the thought, just because he'd accepted that it had passed, didn't mean he couldn't feel bad about it. Just then he felt it. Yes, _it_ was back. No, for it to be back, it should've been gone, but it had never left. 
    
It was in metamorphosis. 
    
The thought was back (but not really, because how can you say it was back, if it had never left?), and he was filled with joy. Quickly, he decided not to dwell on the joy, but to explore the thought. It had changed. Now, the thought had bulbous parts, colors constantly spiralling, and it's size now reaching a point he couldn't comprehend. 
    
He couldn't believe it was his. It's complexity surprising him, scaring him. But it was his, and after all the loss he had felt when it had left, he wasn't going to let it go away.
    
He decided to approach it. In the beginning, he prodded at it with a stick from a distance, but he knew - to make sense of it, he had to get closer. So, closer he got. A punch here, a jab there, but it still alienated him. So, he leaped forward and grabbed it. Now, he wrestled with it, it's weight too great for him to handle. He persevered and slowly, he understood a tiny part of it, and with that understanding came the confidence for another. It devolved from wrestling to mindless beating. It wasn't technique that propelled him anymore, but something much more primal. 
    
The thought - after a while he noticed - was much smaller now. He realized _he_ was much larger. He'd absorbed it. Now, it didn't seem scary to him at all. With a quick burst of energy, he rushed in; he knew this would be the final bout.
    
He crushed the thought. Completely assimilating it into him. A wave of contentment washed over him. He was exhausted, but he was happy. He left a larger, more complex man.

I know most of this is cliche and boring. Unoriginal. I'd understand if you felt second-hand embarrassment ([Fremdscham](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Fremdscham "German word for second-hand embarrassment")). But, if you think there's something that can improved here, let me know! ~~Please don't be too harsh.~~
