For references, I am using the [writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal) page on the GSoC student guide, as well as the [two example proposals](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/proposal-example-1) given at the end. I also managed to find the proposals of the two students who got into CHAOSS last year, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VXV_SOazs299KF9_TPRE7FNvJ4ZytkmQYJCT0X4DSgg/edit#heading=h.v80ae7oo7b2c) and [here](https://github.com/kmn5409/chaoss-microtasks/blob/master/GSoC-2018-Keanu-Nichols-CHAOSS-proposal.pdf).
