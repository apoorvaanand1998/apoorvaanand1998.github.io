* git diff (with no arguments) - diff between the directory and the staging area.
* git diff --staged - diff between staging area and latest commit.
* git show <commit id> - (Has other uses also) Shows changes introduced in commit compared to it's parent. Useful when multiple people present in git log and commits are arranged by timestamps.
* git fetch - Git gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in your current branch and stores them in your local repository as a separate branch. Merging with the current branch is not done. git pull = git fetch + git merge
